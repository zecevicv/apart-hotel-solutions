          <h3>I’m not interested in selling my hotel.</h3>
          <p>And we are not interested in buying your hotel. Instead, we want to create a partnership whereby we plan and pay for the conversion of your hotel to high end serviced accommodation. We then run your hotel on your behalf. Your income will be either in the form of fixed monthly rental payments (guaranteed to be higher than your current operating profit) or a profit-share.</p>

        <li>
          <h3>How much money will I need to convert my hotel to high end serviced accommodation?</h3>
          <p>No funds will be needed from you. We will plan, finance and execute the complete renovation project. </p>
        </li>
        <!-- Item -->
        <li>
          <h3>What about ongoing maintenance and repairs?</h3>
          <p>All maintenance costs and repairs will be covered by us in full and are paid out of the operating revenue of the hotel. </p>
        </li>
        <!-- Item -->
        <li>
          <h3>How much profit will I make from my partnership with you?</h3>
          <p>You will have the option of earning fixed lease (rental) payments, which are guaranteed to be higher than your current operating profit, and also guaranteed to rise in line with market rates. Alternatively, you could opt for a share of the ongoing profits.</p>
        </li>
        <!-- Item -->
        <li>
          <h3>What will the length of the agreement be?</h3>
          <p>The agreement will run for a minimum of five years, after which you will be free to end it at any time by buying us out at fair market value. Alternatively, it will continue running for 20 years, after which time the full value of the renovated hotel reverts back to you. </p>
